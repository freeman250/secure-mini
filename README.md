# SecureMe Mini – Final Project Application

SecureMe Mini is a simple cloud-based web application focused on promoting basic cybersecurity habits. The application provides short security tips and a checklist to help users improve their online safety.

The app is built using Python and Flask, containerized with Docker, and deployed on Amazon Web Services. The Docker image is stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and the application is run using Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) behind an Application Load Balancer. Static assets, such as the banner image, are hosted on Amazon S3 and configured using environment variables.

This project demonstrates containerization, cloud deployment, and integration of multiple AWS services in a real-world application.
